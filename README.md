# Andromeda Theme for Zed

A popular [VScode theme](https://github.com/EliverLara/Andromeda) ported to [Zed](https://zed.dev/) with some minor adjustments (since the Zed's [theme_importer](https://github.com/zed-industries/zed/tree/main/crates/theme_importer) still not good enough to seamlessly replicate VScode themes).

> [!NOTE]
> The port also includes an italic variant
